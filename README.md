## About

This was a reflective response to the 4'33" drop. I wanted each person who took a risk on buying an essentially blank mint to _also_ get a copy which was complete and whole, so if they chose they could display this one in lieu of the other minimal one.

While the primary artwork slowly built up over the course of 4 minutes 33 seconds, this one vanished over the same period of time, leaving behind just the blank canvas.

...spin up a local webserver or just opening index.html should do the trick, see instructions.md for, well, instructions.

## Code usage

I've placed the code here for educational purposes, for anyone who wants to learn from _somewhat_ badly written code. You may not sell/mint/etc. outputs from this code, you may keep, print, display them for personal use. Please see the LICENSE for more information.
